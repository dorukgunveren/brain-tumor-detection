Brain tumor detection usin yolov8n.pt trained on custom dataset with Roboflow and Google Colab. Detects Brain Tumor

This project utilizes the YOLOv8n detection model, trained on a custom brain MRI dataset, to detect and localize brain tumors in medical images. The model processes MRI scans to identify and locate brain tumors. It can make predictions on individual MRI images and provide bounding box coordinates along with confidence scores for detected tumors.
